# n-body simulation
This is just another nbody simulation. I used it for introduction to CUDA development.

# dependencies
- CUDA 5.0
- X11
- gcc 

# run it
Just type make in the command line and rund it
make
./nbody

The Makefile points to the standard Librarypaths. Alternatively you have to change some Paths in the Makefile.
